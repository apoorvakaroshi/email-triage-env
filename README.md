# 📧 EmailTriageEnv

> A real-world email triage environment for training and evaluating AI agents.

[![OpenEnv Compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenEnv-Compliant-green)](https://openenv.dev)
[![HF Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/HF-Spaces-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/appuk10/email-triage-env)

## Overview

EmailTriageEnv simulates a workplace email inbox. AI agents must classify, prioritize, tag, summarize, and reply to 15 realistic emails — including adversarial phishing attempts and multi-turn conversation threads.

All reward scores are **strictly between 0 and 1** (the open interval `(0, 1)`) — endpoints are excluded by design.

## Tasks

| # | Name | Difficulty | Description |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `email_classification` | Easy | Classify into 7 categories + detect adversarial emails |
| 2 | `inbox_prioritization` | Medium | Rank 5 emails by urgency (Kendall tau) |
| 3 | `email_tagging` | Medium-Hard | Apply tags from 12-tag vocab (F1 scored) |
| 4 | `reply_drafting` | Hard | Draft professional reply covering required talking points |
| 5 | `email_summarization` | Medium | Summarize email in 10-60 words |
| 6 | `thread_classification` | Hard | Classify multi-turn thread + extract key issue |

---

## Unique Features

- **Adversarial emails** — Phishing and social-engineering emails that agents must detect
- **Multi-turn threads** — 3 realistic back-and-forth email chains for thread tasks
- **Sender trust scores** — Every email includes a pre-computed domain trust score (0–1)
- **Strict score range** — All graders clamp to `(0.001, 0.999)` — never touching 0 or 1

## Reward Function

All scores are returned as `float` strictly in `(0.0, 1.0)`:

| Task | Scoring method |
|------|---------------|
| Classification | Exact match → 0.90, related category → 0.45, wrong → 0.05 |
| Prioritization | Kendall tau mapped from [-1,1] to (0,1) |
| Tagging | F1 score scaled to (0.05, 0.95) |
| Reply drafting | Talking-point coverage + professionalism markers |
| Summarization | Length compliance + key-term coverage |
| Thread classification | Category match (50%) + keyword coverage (50%) |
